Yo, Mullins. Just making a public repository for us to do some version control on whatever
code we do manage to produce for mike-space.com. This way we can keep a running history of
all our changes to the site. Right now, any code added to this repository is public and
totally open source, so don't put anything that you want to keep secret on here b/c
theoretically anyone can get at it...I mostly just wanted to try this git-hub website out
in order to do some free version control. If we ever actually produce anything ownage for
mike-space that we want to keep proprietary, we'll have to take it off here and remove
the repository from this site.

Annnnnnd suck-em.
